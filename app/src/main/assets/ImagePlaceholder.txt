PLACEHOLDER IMAGE EXAMPLE

For each image needed, you should:

1. Create or find an appropriate image file
2. Rename it to match the required name in the list (e.g., category_stationery.png)
3. Make sure it's in PNG or JPG format
4. Add it to the app/src/main/res/drawable folder

Example for category icons:
- Find 5 icons (one for each category)
- Make sure they're square, ideally 96x96 pixels
- Save them with transparent backgrounds as PNG files
- Rename them to: category_stationery.png, category_culinary.png, etc.
- Add them to the drawable folder

Example for product images:
- Find or take product photos for each item
- Crop them to be rectangular (4:3 ratio works well)
- Size them appropriately (around 400x300 pixels is good)
- Save them as JPG or PNG files
- Rename them to: product_waterbottle.jpg, product_phone_cover.jpg, etc.
- Add them to the drawable folder

The app has been configured to load these images by name, so as long as you use the exact filenames listed in the requirements, everything will work automatically.
